# Optimization of Distributed Content Caching on the Edge of Wireless Networks with Malicious Users

### Introduction
Content caching on the edge of wireless networks is a promising approach for increasing network performance.
Generally, there are two types of users:
* Eligible user which always requests its required data.
* Adversary user, also known as malicious user, which its purpose is to make the back-haul links congested.

In this project, in order to deal with Adversary users a [Multi-leader One-follower Stackelberg Game](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8371277) is implemented in MATLAB programming language.
